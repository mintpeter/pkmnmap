extract_maps.py is from the pokemontools package.

blocksearch.py will dump CSV data of where all the grass and water patches are.
    TODO: I forgot that it sets all the route_ids to 1. Whoops. It needs to look
    at the map's name according to extract_maps and figure out the location_id
    from a Pokedex query.

text_translator.py will translate from hex to text or the other way around
according to the text table defined in text-table.txt.
    This is probably reusable.

I will definitely need to rip the map images, or this is useless. That's my next
task.
